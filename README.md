# Network-Analysis-of-P2P-Bus-Routes-in-Metro-Manila---Sprint-4
With our current situation where there is a need to improve the transportation experience of commuters especially during these times in a pandemic with more restrictions in public transportation. How can we help public commuters improve their commuting experience by improving the P2P routes?

Our group used networkx to create a network analysis of the P2P Bus Routes and identified structural holes as opportunities for new routes. Osmnx was used to determine the shortest distance between the suggested routes.
